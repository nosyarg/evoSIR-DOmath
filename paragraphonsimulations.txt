In order to simulate the evosir process in the exponential time case, we used an algorithm which
represented infection, recovery, and rewire events as an exponential race, and handled time
implicitly.
In the constant time case, the infection and rewire events were
represented as an exponential race, but a running tally of time was kept
for the recovery events.
The code was written in python using the networkx package for the graph
generation and dynamics, and the graphs were generated in R using
ggplot2.
